{- |
A version of the 'Newtype' typeclass and related functions.  The API is
primarily pulled from Conor McBride's Epigram work. The general idea is that we
can manipulate types in terms of newtypes around them or newtypes in terms of
their underlying types. Some examples:

>>> ala Sum foldMap [1,2,3,4]
10

>>> ala Endo foldMap [(+1), (+2), (subtract 1), (*2)] 3
8

>>> under2 Min (<>) 2 1
1

>>> over All not (All False)
All {getAll = True)

The version of the 'Newtype' class exported by this module has an instance for
/all/ and /only/ newtypes with 'Generic' instances whose generated
'Coercible' instances are visible. Users need not, and probably should not, write
their own instances.

Like McBride's version, and unlike the one in @newtype-generics@, this version
has two parameters: one for the newtype and one for the underlying type. This
is mostly a matter of taste.

__Note__: Most functions in this module take an argument representing a newtype
constructor. This is used only for its type. To make that clear, the type of
that argument is allowed to be extremely polymorphic: @o \`to\` n@ rather than
@o -> n@. Unfortunately, GHCi displays this as @to o n@, which is ugly but
equivalent.

General approach: When the type variables @n@ and @o@ appear, @n@ is required
to be a newtype wrapper around @o@. Similarly, when the type variables @n'@ and
@o'@ appear as well, @n'@ is required to be a newtype wrapper around @o'@.
Furthermore, in this case, @n@ and @n'@ are required to be the /same newtype/,
with possibly different type arguments. See 'Similar' for detailed
documentation.

Unfortunately, the fancy type machinery in this module doesn't always produce
the best results when asking GHCi for a type, and may result in some confusing
type errors. Most of the worst error messages result from ambiguous types,
so look out for the words "ambiguity check" in type errors before trying to
puzzle through too much of the rest. Errors involving a 'Skeleton' likely
mean that GHC failed to determine that two types are 'Similar' because they
are ambiguous.

[Note: Similar implementation]

The Similar class is what really separates this implementation of this API from
all previous ones of which I am aware. Since it's not the simplest thing, I'll
give an extended description of the implementation here.

We really want n to give us information about n'. It's also nice (for typed
holes and error messages, particularly) if n' gives us information about n.
Since we may know nothing, a priori, about one of those, we have to be a bit
careful not to force a match on one when the other is the one with information.
The horrible way to do that (even worse :t results!) is with INCOHERENT
typeclass instances. Ignoring that awfulness, the thing to do is to require n'
to have a structure calculated from n and the other way around, "in parallel".

Why build a skeleton of each type rather than just rebuilding each along the
other? Using a skeleton lets us get full transitivity and barely-constrained
reflexivity, both of which are really lovely properties to have.

Here's an example of how it works.

Suppose we have n ~ F a b and n'.

Then

    GetSkeleton n
  = GetSkeleton (F a b)
  = 'App (GetSkeleton (F a))
  = 'App ('App (GetSkeleton F))
  = 'App ('App ('Con F))

Now

    Rebuild (GetSkeleton n) n'
  = Rebuild ('App ('App ('Con F))) n'
  = Rebuild ('App ('Con F)) (GetFun n') (GetArg n')
  = Rebuild ('Con F) (GetFun (GetFun n')) (GetArg (GetFun n')) (GetArg n')
  = F (GetFun (GetFun n')) (GetArg (GetFun n')) (GetArg n')

So (Rebuild (GetSkeleton n) n' ~ n') forces n' to be built from the type
constructor F. The equality constraints induced on the arguments of n'
don't seem to be useful, but I believe this is the only way to get an equality
constraint on n' itself that lets GHC know it's F x y for some x and y to be
determined. Very often, those are then fixed by the type o' and the Newtype n'
o' constraint, which at first seems backwards. Say we consider Sum. We have

  type Rep (Sum a) = M1 _ _ (M1 _ _ (M1 _ _ (K1 _ a)))

This can reduce as soon as GHC sees we have Sum whatever! So then the
Newtype constraint can constrain the type argument to whatever's required
to wrap the new contents. Magic!
